The Doomed Dice Challenge
Problem Statement:
The below problems must be solved & implemented in Python / Java / Ruby / C++ / Go.

You are given two six-sided dice, Die A and Die B, each with faces numbered from 1 to 6.

You can only roll both dice together, and your turn is guided by the obtained sum.

Example:
If Die A = 6 and Die B = 3, then the sum is: 6+3=9
You may represent the dice as an Array or Array-like structure.
For example:


DieA = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
where the indices represent the 6 faces of the die & the values represent the number on each face.
